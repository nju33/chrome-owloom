Use bookmarks better

## Usage

### Command setting

It is recommended that you register and use your favorite shortcut below. I set it to `Alt + B`.

- `Open Lwloom window`  
  <div>Open Owloom. Owloom is closed when the link is opened or the window is out of focus.</div>
  
<details>

</details>

By the way, even if you do not set a shortcut, you can also open it by clicking on the icon to be added in the upper right
